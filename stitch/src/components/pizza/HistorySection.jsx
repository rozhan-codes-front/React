                    Neapolitan pizza, a culinary icon originating from Naples, Italy, boasts a rich history dating back to the 18th century.
                    Initially a simple flatbread topped with lard, salt, and garlic, it evolved with the introduction of tomatoes from the New World.
                    By the late 19th century, the classic Margherita pizza emerged, honoring Queen Margherita of Savoy with its red (tomato), white (mozzarella),
                    and green (basil) toppings, mirroring the Italian flag. Today, Neapolitan pizza is celebrated globally for its simplicity, quality ingredients,
                    and traditional preparation methods, including baking in a wood-fired oven at high temperatures.
